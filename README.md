# Differential Equations solver using Taylor Series
Final project for Comp. Phys. 2017-1
Simple integrator written in Python 2.7

Example using Duffing Oscillator and chaos analysis [ipynb in spanish]
Convergence and precision tests included [ipynb]

This was written a long time ago so it probably has tons of bugs, but it was a nice experiment.
